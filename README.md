# 👗 Women's Clothing Recommendation/Prediction Project

This project aims to build a predictive model that provides insights or recommendations for women's clothing based on customer data, reviews, or purchase patterns. It leverages machine learning to enhance personalization, improve inventory planning, and increase customer satisfaction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict customer preferences or sales trends for women's clothing items using structured data (e.g., reviews, product categories, age, etc.).
- **Approach**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🧠 Features & Functionality

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Visualized trends in clothing preferences across demographics.
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Built models to predict:
  - Customer satisfaction
  - Purchase likelihood
  - Clothing category demand
- 🔍 **Evaluation**: Compared model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and many more

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning
  - `xgboost` / `lightgbm` – advanced modeling (optional)
  - `streamlit` – for web-based demo (if applicable)
